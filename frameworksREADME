xcode project - start with empty project. COMMAND-SHIFT-N

- Move the project from  its own dir created to one dir up
- Add all the files. 

 1. On the general project add "settings.xcconfig" configuration for debug and release

 2. Open Framework and library dir of interest

    Qt: open  $QTDIR/lib

 3. add macos library target "libraryName". Static STLC++ to archive the executable. Identifier: library name
    a. remove libraryName dir
    b. source is libraryName.cc (build phases)

 4. add command tools exampleName, source is example.cc
    a. remove exampleName dir
    b. add libraryName in the target dependencies (build phases)
    c. drag frameworks to link Binary with Libraries on Build Phases 
    d. drag frameworks to Copy files:
 	- no subpath
	- uncheck Copy only when installing
	- executables

5.  Build Settings: Code Signing: do not code sign

 5. For archiving purposes, in build phases copy necessary items in "executables destination", 
     - this includes the rcc file (in case it's needed, see qtButtonsWidget)
     - uncheck Copy only when installing
    To run the app by command line, add @executable_path to run path in Linking
